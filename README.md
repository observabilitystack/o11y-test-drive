# 🔎 (Open Source) Observability Test Drive Workshop

> 📍 DevOpsCon Munich 2022

This is the code and slides we'll be using during our observability
workshop.

## 👴🏻 Observability theory

TBD

## 🔬 Your test laboratory instance

TBD

## 🏎️ Test drive observability suites

We are going to give several observability suites a test drive. We'll
integrate

* APM (application performance monitoring) a.k.a. Tracing
* Metrics
* Logs

We are going to use SaaS cloud offerings as far as possbile and
feasable.

### 📦 [Build and deploy the example application](spring-petclinic/README.md)

We are going to use the Spring Petclinic application as our test
application.

### #1: [Prometheus & Grafana](prometheus-grafana/README.md)

This candidate is very close to a self-hosted open source experience.
We are going to host a Prometheus instance ourselves but leverage the
Grafana Cloud for displaying dashboards, metrics and traces.

### #2: [Elastic Stack](elastic/README.md)

### #3: [New Relic](new-relic/README.md)

## 🏎️ Further test drive candidates

### Sentry

### Java Flight Recorder
