# ðŸ›¬ Java Flight Recorder

The Java flight recorder (JFR) is a great tool to gather extensive insights into
a running Java JRE. It's free and is shipped along every recent JDK (11+). The
observability process here has two steps

1. Record a Java Flight Recording of an application for given timeframe (e.g. 60s)
2. Analyze the recording using [JDK Mission Control](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/products-jmc8-downloads.html)

## ðŸ“¼ Create a flight recording

You have to create the recording inside the running Docker container.

```bash
docker exec -it spring-petclinic-petclinic-1 bash
JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS="" jcmd $(pgrep java) JFR.start name=profile duration=60s filename=current.jfr settings=profile
JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS="" jcmd $(pgrep java) JFR.check
```

Then, move it outside the Docker container on to the host system. From here
you should be able to transfer it to your local machine.

```bash
docker cp spring-petclinic-petclinic-1:/current.jfr ~/$(hostname)-$(date '+%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S').jfr
```
